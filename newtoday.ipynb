Sterling was informed by the candidate that they didn't use an accountant for the self-employment at Adecco. Hence Sterling has contacted the candidate to provide suitable self-employment start and end date documents for 11-Nov-2020 to 30-Mar-2021 to proceed with the verification as the provided document doesn't confirm the dates nor have candidate's name in it. However the candidate is unresponsive. Your response will be highly appreciated. Thank you.

CAUTION: This email originated from outside of the organization. Do not click links or open attachments unless you recognize the sender and know the content is safe.  Managers Greetings from Prompt. Would like to inform you as per Tata com HR Policy there is 04 mandatory online training to be completed by all contingent workers on Tatacomm Training portal for that we have already sent multiple reminders to all employees in the last few months however most of your team members haven’t completed training yet. Since this is mandatory training and part of compliance audit hence can’t be delayed anymore and here after all so many follow-ups on emails/SMS employees are not showing seriousness in this direction. Considering the situation and to avoid compliance audit issues our discussion was done with the TCL HR team and we have been instructed to hold Nov. month salary and we have informed employees that Nov-22 salary will not be credited to those who have still not completed training on the portal. The purpose of holding a salary is to not let employees suffer but to draw their attention to long pending compliance training. Would request all of you to refer attached report andprovide your support by pushing them in this regard and complete the task before 18th Nov. Below is the credential Login URL: Username: 7 digit Prism ID Password: Welcome@12 Those who are facing any login issue can write email India.Contingent@tatacommunications.com or can share confirmation of completed training on pavitra@promptpersonnel.com Pavitra Salvi Coordinator Head office: 612/613 Palm Spring Centre New Link Road Above Croma Malad W Mumbai 400064.

Kindly clarify. Sandeep. From: From The HR Team <hr.team@tatacommunications.com> Sent: Friday January 19 2024 10:10 AM To: Employee Provident Fund <EPF@tatacommunications.com> Subject: Update on Employee Provident Fund - Annual additional interest ! ! !  members The trustees are glad to convey to all members on an update from Employee Provident Fund Trust. Annual additional interest 2022-23: The Tata CommunicationsEmployees Provident Fund Trust Trust has approved annual interest of 8.30% including 0.15% special interest for the financial year ended 31st March 2023. The trust at its meeting organised on 28th September 2023 approved the above interest which shall be paid to eligible members. For the seventeenth consecutive year the Trust has been able to approve additional special interest. The trustees arrived at the decision after duly reviewing the financial position of the Trust considering the trust investments earnings and surplus thereon available for appropriation. The one-time additional special interest @ 0.15% for the Financial Year 2022-23 is over and above the statutory rate of 8.15% per annum as announced by the EPFO for that year. This special interest would be credited to the individual PF accounts of the eligible members who have PF accumulation balance as on 31st March 2023 as of 18th January 2024 under the head “Additional Interest”. For the purpose of income tax wherever applicable the date of this announcement is the effective date on which the additional interest gets accrued to the members or ex-members. Any tax obligations arising out of this additional interest so credited; shall be borne by the respective member. The applicable TDS 10%/20% on this one-time additional interest will be deducted and remitted to the Income Tax authority by the PF Trust. It is requested to visit PF Portalto check your projected PF statement OnePlace > Provident Fund > PF statement > Tax statement on periodic basis to review the taxable income and applicable TDS. To get the TDS deducted on monthly basis you may like to declare the same on thePeople strong Portal to avoid the one-time deduction at end of the year/ self-assessment before filling the return.
